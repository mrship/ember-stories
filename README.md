# Ember Stories

* This is a simple website to show some of the concepts behind an [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com/) app. 
* There's a live example at http://stories.cllearview.com.
* It uses the [Local Storage Adapater](https://github.com/rpflorence/ember-localstorage-adapter) and [Ember Data](https://github.com/emberjs/data) to store a story title and text locally in the browser.
* To learn more about how this works with a Rails backend, it's worth watching Yehuda Katz's [talk at Rails Israel](http://lanyrd.com/2013/railsisrael/scpwcc/)
